# House Loan Approval Classifier
This project demonstrates how to create and evaluate various classification models using a sample dataset. The script includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation of different classification algorithms.

Dataset
Ensure you have your dataset saved in a CSV file (e.g., your_dataset.csv). The dataset should be structured such that the last column is the target variable and the other columns are the features.

Requirements
Before running the script, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
seaborn
matplotlib
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
Script Overview
The script performs the following steps:

Load the Dataset: Reads the dataset from a CSV file.
Split the Dataset: Separates the dataset into features (X) and target (y).
Train-Test Split: Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Standardize the Data: Applies standardization to the features.
Initialize Models: Sets up various classification models.
Train and Evaluate Models: Trains each model and evaluates its accuracy on the test set.
Usage
Place your dataset in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path to the dataset.
Modify the script if necessary to fit your dataset's specific structure.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python classification_comparison.py
